### concurrency-notes
I sometimes feel like everyone's using the same words and talking about different things, so hopefully this serves as a decent way to write down definitions and in what context(s) those definitions are valid.

Goals:
* Define commonly-used terms
* Write down which terms/concepts are commonly grouped/used together
* Write down common concurrency practices for some languages

Note: I tend to use "concurrency" as shorthand for "running things independently of each other", and only try to disambiguate between "concurrent" and "parallel" when I think the conflation of the two words is likely to create confusion. Please donut hesitate to point out if this is wrong.
